# Infinite Checkbox Tree

Based on the data source being an array of objects with properties name and children, this code can render an infinite checkbox tree. If only some of a node's children are selected will a node have an indeterminate status, otherwise it is checked or un-checked.,

## Installation

- Please clone down the repository
- cd into the folder and run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to see a demo of the checkbox tree in action.
